# Modularization

The initial levels modularization of the implementation for training models.
This involves using the implementation from the first neural networks notebook,
and converting it into a modularized implementation. There are two main files:

- models.py
- utils.py

## models.py

The script contains the model architecture class used to train the models.

## utils.py

The script contains functions related to plotting the images from the data
loaders, training the model and testing the model performance.

## exec notebook

The execution of the program is done in the exec.ipynb file which imports the
model and utility functions from the respective modules and uses them to train
the model.
